Once a build is delivered, another iteration of this cycle may be started.</p> <p>As soon as the decision service interface is stable, or the event structure is well defines the development team should be able to deploy the rule set under construction to the execution server in order to test it with an end-to-end scenario. The integration of the decision service and the domain object model is an important task. Integration involves the marshaling of data to/from external data sources, transform it to the rule business object model view so it can be understood by the execution engine. This is 'mapping' of the data to the Rule Business Object Model created in previous activities is very important as it is a very bad practice to take an existing enterprise model, or a canonical model to be the foundation of the rule processing. Too much genericity and complexity will impact rule adoption by the business users, and knowledge transfer between developers too.</p> <p>There are a number of tools and techniques that can be used to marshal data, and the best choice will vary depending of the technologies available: ESB, micro services, ETL, batch processing, event based processing.... When this activity is completed, data (preferably 'real' data) will be sent to the rule engine to fire rules, make decision and the results delivered over the same channels as the production system.

From a business perspective, a business rule is a precise statement that describes, constrains, or controls some aspect of the business.</p> <p>Let's illustrate this concept with a simple example coming from the lending industry. The following business policy can be established to limit the loan amount a bank can purchase:</p> <p>Only prime loans are eligible for purchase</p> <p>This policy may be split into two implemented rules, one defining what a prime loan is and the second taking the decision on purchasing it or not.</p> <pre><code>If the loan amount is less than the prime loan limit, then the loan type is Prime\n\nIf the loan type is not Prime then reject the loan\n</code></pre> <p>Implementing these rules using an Object Oriented Language may look like two if statements testing conditions on objects, and applying actions on the same or other objects</p> <pre><code>\nif (loan.amount &lt; PrimeLoanLimit) {\n    loan.type = PrimeType;\n}\n\nif (loan.type != PrimeType) {\n    case = new Case(\"Loan is not Prime\");\n    loan.status = REJECT;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The concept of business rules is not new, and for decades analysts and developers were implementing them within business applications. Since the introduction of a Business Rule Management System application, early 2000, which provides tools to manage the rule as a standalone element, outside of the core business application, and in a form which is executable by a rule engine.</p> <p>Business rules are packaged as a Rule Set which can be considered as a piece of software executed by a rule engine. Integrated in a business application, the rule set implements a sub-set of the business logic. This logic is externalized from the traditional code and can be easily changed, and maintained by business analysts instead of developers.</p> <p>As opposed to business logic embedded and hidden in functions, procedures, macros or databases, business rules are clearly separated from the rule engine, a software component which executes and activates rules based on matching conditions on a set of data.</p> <p>Figure 1 below illustrates this fundamental approach in implementing business logic, with the old embedded model on the left and the new architecture on the right. In many ways the approach is similar to the separation of code and data which Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) brought in the 1970s.</p> <p></p> <p>A piece of business logic or rule embedded in code will be more difficult to identify, locate, and change, therefore increases costs of maintenance.</p> <p>A rule which is externalized in a BRMS platform, and whose versions are controlled in a rule repository and deployed and executed in a rule engine, will be much easier to modify, thus reducing dramatically the time and cost to implement changes required by the business.</p> <p>Traditional software life cycles such as the V cycle or waterfall model are notorious for leading to systems which costs more than expected, come to market later than planned and with outcomes not matching the clients' initial expectations. With such approaches, the business users have little ownership of the solution, and the time required to implement changes can easily range from 3 to 6 months if not more. As a result, policy owners don't feel comfortable with change which translates into a loss of agility to respond to new business and competitive situations: too much time passes between policy owners submitting requirements to IT and the actual deployment of new rules.</p> <p>Also, with all the fine tuning and iterations, policy owners cannot really be sure that the policy is being implemented according to their needs. The only way to actually know is to keep performing tests and hope that all the cases are covered in such tests.</p> <p>As important element of the business decision, the business rules need strong management processes and tools to support their life cycle.</p> <p>A BRMS provides solutions to make this management more efficient, both for developers and for the business users of the applications. Obviously tooling is not the single answer to the software and business challenges behind the development of decision-support systems. Deploying BRMS, BRE, and BPM components into business applications requires to modify current development methodologies and practices in order to take into account new concepts as well as providing a better collaboration framework between IT and business.</p> <p>The Agile Business Rule Development methodology corresponds to such a need. It is an incremental and iterative software development process leveraging the Agile Alliance manifesto (Agile Manifesto). Here are some of the Agile development values particularly relevant to the implementation of a rule set using the ABRD approach:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. The rule discovery, analysis and validation activities require an active and efficient communication between the rule developer and the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Such processes are defined as light as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Working software over comprehensive documentation. The proposed rule set development done per iteration, with its validation step, is based on the evidence that a working and executable rule set has much more business value than a rule description manual. All the project stakeholders benefit from such a principle but in particular the business users who are then sure that what they see (the rules) is what gets executed in the deployed system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Subject Matter Experts who define the business policies and the business rules are strongly involved in the development process. They are the customers of the final system, owners of the policies and are conveniently co-located with the development team during the project.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responding to change over following a plan. Business rules evolve, more often and faster than other standard pieces of software. This is actually one of the key values of the business rule approach.

The team decides how big a point is, and based on that size, determines how many points each work item is. To make estimation go fast, use only full points, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, rather than fractions of a point, such 0.25, or 1.65 points. To get started, look at 10 or so representative work items, give the smallest the size of one point, and then go through all other work items and give them a relative point estimate based on that point. Note that points are used for high-level estimates, so do not spend too much time on any one item. This is especially true for work items of lower priority, to avoid wasting effort on things that are unlikely to be addressed within the current iteration.</p> <p>A key benefit of points is that they are neutral and relative. Let\u2019s say that Ann is 3 times more productive than Jack. If Ann and Jack agree that work item A is worth 1 point, and they both think work item B is roughly 5 times as big, they can rapidly agree that work item B is worth 5 points. Ann may however think work item B can be done in 12 hours, while Jack thinks it can be done in 36 hours. That is fine, they may disagree about the actual effort required to do it, but we do not care at this point in time, we only want the team to agree on the relative size. We will later use Velocity to determine how much \u2018size\u2019, or how many points, the team can take on within an iteration.</p> <p>One project team may say that a work item of a certain size is worth 1 point. Another project team would estimate the same sized work item to be worth 5 points. That is fine, as long as you are consistent within the same project. Make sure that the entire team is involved in assessing size, or at least that the same people are involved in all your size estimates, to ensure consistency within your project. We will see how the concept of velocity will fix also this discrepancy in a point meaning different things to different project teams.</p> <p>You can also use other measures of size, where the most common alternative is Ideal Days.</p>"},{"location":"methodology/abrd/concepts/#velocity","title":"Velocity","text":"<p>Velocity is a key metric used for iteration planning. It indicates how many points are delivered upon within an iteration for a certain team and project. As an example, a team planned to accomplish 20 points in the first iteration. At the end of the iteration, they noticed that they only delivered upon 14 points, their velocity was hence 14. For the next iteration, they may plan for fewer points, let\u2019s say 18 points, since they think they can do a little better than in previous iteration. In this iteration, they delivered 17 points, giving them a velocity of 17.</p> <p>Expect the velocity to change from iteration to iteration. Some iterations go smoother than others, and points are not always identical in terms of effort. Some team members are more effective than others, and some problems end up being harder than others. Also, changes to the team structure, learning new skills, changes to the tool environment, better teaming, or more overhead with meetings or tasks external to the project will all impact velocity. In general, velocity typically increases during the project as the team builds skills and becomes more cohesive.</p> <p>Velocity compensates for differences between teams in terms of how big a point is. Let\u2019s assume that project team Alpha and project team Beta are equally efficient in developing software, and they run the same project in parallel. Team Alpha, however, assesses all work items as being worth 3 times as many points as team Beta's estimates. Team Alpha assesses work item A, B, C, and D to correspond to 30 points, and team Beta estimates the same work items to correspond to 10 points. Both teams deliver upon those 4 work items in the next iteration, giving team Alpha a velocity of 30, and team Beta a velocity of 10. It may sound as if team Alpha is more effective, but let\u2019s look at what happens when they plan the next iteration. They both want to take on work item E-H, which team Alpha has estimated to be 30 points, and team Beta as normal has estimated to be \u2153 as many points, or 10 points. Since a team can typically take on as many points as indicated by their velocity, they can both take on all of E-H. The end result is that it does not matter how big a point is, as long as you are consistent within your team.</p> <p>Velocity also averages out the efficiency of different team members. Let\u2019s look at an example; Let\u2019s assume that Ann always works 3 times as fast as Jack and Jane. Ann will perhaps deliver 9 points per iteration, and Jack and Jane 3 points each per iteration. The velocity of that 3-person team will be 15 points. As mentioned above, Ann and Jack may not agree on how much effort is associated with a work item, but they can agree on how many points it is worth. Since the team velocity is 15, the velocity will automatically translate the point estimate to how much work can be taken on. As you switch team members, or as team members become more or less efficient, your velocity will change, and you can hence take on more or less points. This does however not require you to change the estimate of the size. The size is still the same, and the velocity will help you to calculate how much size you can deliver upon with the team at hand for that iteration.</p>"},{"location":"methodology/abrd/concepts/#estimation-of-effort","title":"Estimation of Effort","text":"<p>Estimation of Effort translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort typically using the units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. As you plan an iteration, you will take on a work item, such as detail, design, implement and test a scenario, which may be sized to 5 points. Since this is still a reasonably big work item, break it down into a number of smaller work items, such as 4 separate work items for Detailing, Designing, Implementing and Testing Server portion, and Implementing and Testing Client portion of the scenario. Team members are asked to sign up for the tasks, and then detail the estimate of the actual effort, measured in hours or days, for their tasks. In this case, the following actual estimates were done (with person responsible within parenthesis):</p> <ul> <li>Detailing scenario (Ann): 4 hours</li> <li>Designing scenario (Ann and Jack):  6 hours</li> <li>Implementing and Testing Server portion of scenario (Jack): 22 hours</li> <li>Implementing and Testing Client portion of scenario (Ann): 12 hours</li> <li>Total Effort Estimate for Scenario: 44 hours</li> </ul> <p>If other people would be assigned to the tasks, the estimated actual hours could be quite different. There is hence no point doing detailed estimates until you know who will do the work, and what actual problems you will run into. Often, some level of analysis and design of the work item needs to take place before a reasonable estimate can be done. Remember that estimates are still estimates, and a person assigned to a task should feel free (and be encouraged) to re-estimate the effort required to complete the task, so we have a realistic view of progress within an iteration.</p>"},{"location":"methodology/model/","title":"Different Data Models","text":"<p>The development of modern business application using cloud native microservices, long running business processes, decision services, different data stores, events, existing software as service like CRM or ERP applications, AI,... are adding complexity on the data view, data transformation and the data modeling. Some older approaches of adopting a unique canonical model, has some advantages and some counter productive ones. With microservice adoption, and applying a domain driven design it is easier to define a bounded context of a microservice, but as soon as you start coding you immediately encounter questions about your information model and what shapes it should have. Canonical model is kept at the messaging or integration layer to do a one to one mapping between model. </p> <p>This note presents the reality view of the different data model to consider. At the end the goal is still to apply clear separation of concern, focus on data needed for implementing business logic, and adapt interface for easy consumption and reuse.</p> <p>The following figure illustrates a potential business automation solution using different components, supported on top of different software products.</p> <p></p> <p>From Top-Left bottom right:</p> <ul> <li>Single Page applications are running in Web Browser and use different javascript library to support HTML rendering, business logic implementation and data model as JSON document. The model view is focusing to expose data to user and to support form entries. The app interacts with one Backend For Frontend app's REST API or other services with CORS support. The model and API are designed for this user centric application. </li> <li>Microservices are exposing model via their APIs, in Java EE, it used to be named Data Transfer Object, and it is still used, named this way in microservice. The focus on this model is to enforce reusability, and expose APIs about the main business entity or aggregate (Domain Driven Design - Aggregate). This entity is persisted in different formats, and when using traditional SQL based technology, Object Relational Mapping is needed. In Java, hibernate ORM is used with JPA to support transaction and entity annotation. Quarkus Panache is a nice way to map business entity transparently to DB. But still we need to design those models. Within the microservice, we will also find specific implementation model used to support the business logic the service implements. </li> <li>The adoption of JSON document to get a more flexible, schemaless model, helps at the technology selection to be more agile as the model can evolve easily, but still we need to think and design such models. </li> <li>Modern business applications are using Artificial Intelligence model. To make it more generic, we defined a predictive scoring service which compute a score between 0 to 1, given a feature set represented as tuples. It does not have to be a predictive scoring and can anything a machine learned model can support, but exposed with an API with flat model.</li> </ul> <p>In the middle we have an integration layer:</p> <ul> <li>The modern event backbone to support event streaming. The event model is also defined with schema, and any application producing such event, needs to have a specific model to represent fact, of what happens in their boundary.</li> <li>Enterprise service buses are still in scope, as service gateway, interface mapping, and heteregeonous integration is needed. The model definition will better fit to the adoption of canonical model to facilitate the one to one mapping between source and destination models.  </li> <li>Those integration can do data mapping with application like CRM, ERP running as system. The name ASBO for application specific business object was used, and it still applies in modern solution. We need to consider them as-is or using mapping. </li> <li>Some business applications need to get human involved, in the form of workflow, where process application implements the workflow and define process variables to keep data between process tasks. Those data are persisted with process instances within the Business Process Management datasource. The business process can be triggered by user interface (claiming to start a process), by exposing a service, in this case we are back to the DTO definition, or triggered asynchronously via messages (back to a message model). </li> <li>Externalizing business rules, is still a relevant pattern, and in the case of decision modeling, a specific data model to support the rules inference and simplify the rule processing is needed. This is what we called Rule Business Object in te agile business rule development methodology.</li> </ul> <p>The persisted information model (in system of records or DB) is different than the process variable in BPM, which different than the rule business object model used to make decision. </p> <p>A good architecture leverages different information model views to carry the data to the different layers of the business application: the user interface, the database, the service contract, the business process data, the messaging structure, the events, the business rules, the raw document, the AI scoring input data.... There is nothing new in this, but better to keep that in mind anyway when developing new solutions.</p> <p>The information model for such service has to be designed so there is minimum dependency between consumers and providers. The approach of trying to develop a unique rich information model to support all the different consumers, may lead having the consumers dealing with complex data structure sparsely populated.</p> <p>When defining service specifications it is important to assess if each business entities supported by the service operations is going to have different definitions or if the same definition applies to the whole service portfolio?</p> <p>The scope of reuse of data types is an important architecture decision; there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, a few different patterns are emerging:</p> <ul> <li>One object model per interface: Using an independent data model for every service interface assures the highest level of decoupling between services. As negative, the consumers have to understand different representations of the same business entities across multiple services and have to cope with all the relative data transformations. This strategy can be very effective for coarse-grained service operations that do not exchange large amount of data with consumers.</li> <li>One object model per business domain: the service information models are organized in domains, every domain sharing the same data model. The downside of this approach, is once domains are defined, changing their boundaries can be costly.</li> <li>A single object model for the whole enterprise: the approach is to define a single common set of data structures shared across all the enterprise service interfaces. The amount of model customization is kept to a minimum and its management is centralized. The negatives are having overly complicated model the consumers need to process. As of now it becomes a bad practices to adopt such canonical model at the API, persistence and eventing level. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"methodology/overview/","title":"Business Automation implementation methodology","text":""},{"location":"methodology/overview/#business-automation-application-development","title":"Business automation application development","text":"<p>A business process is an interrelated series of activities that convert business inputs into business outputs.

We will only focus on the Validate Invoice Data step in the flow.  OK, let's launch the demo.</p> <p>Customer invoice submissions</p> <p>We start by becoming the customer.  From the Focus Corp Accounts Payable Invoices portal, we select an invoice ending with R (therefore it should be rejected) and submit for rule validation.  We review five key data fields extracted from the invoice using intelligent document processing and then submit for validation.  This invoice is rejected by the business rules as the total amount must be greater than 0.</p> <p>Let's resubmit that invoice by fixing the total amount to $100 and see what the rules say.  We can also take a look at the fields that the business rules use to make their decision.  And this time, the corrected invoice is accepted and passes rule validation.</p> <p>We have various other invoices to try, let's select another one ending in R that should be rejected, but this time the rules do not find an issue and it is accepted.  This type of result means more rework in downstream business processes as humans are involved in more review and the invoice is routed back and forth to be fixed.</p> <p>Operations week 1</p> <p>Further, we can see from the Operations Specialist's week 1 dashboard that the average invoice processing time in the upper right is unmanageable at above 100 minutes.  Further, the rules deviated from the final result on more than 60 invoices this week, adding to rework. Rules must change at the speed of the changing business so let's see how we can improve the business rules.</p> <p>Rules manager</p> <p>As a rules manager, we have access to the invoice validation decision model. The ruleflow orchestrates the decision making process using a text rule to check the total amount is more than $0 which resulted in our first invoice being rejected.  A decision table looks for combinations of PO numbers and supplier types that do not follow the correct pattern (update!).  This is where the second invoice should have be rejected but the table is missing a new invalid pattern.</p> <p>The rules manager, a business user, edits the decision model, adds a new row, easily does a copy/paste of the existing row to get a head start, exactly like a spreadsheet, adjusts the values to match the new Inc. based rejection pattern and the rule is ready.  Tables automatically generate multiple text rules that follow the same pattern so we do not have to write them all from scratch.</p> <p>Let's validate our work by running the test suite to confirm the business logic is now correct.</p> <p>Now we'll move beyond functional testing and onto simulation. After running a new simulation and comparing side by side, the business can make an informed decision about the impact of new rules before ever deploying to production.  Yes, this looks as expected so we are ready to deploy.  In this case, the business can deploy on their own but this can be configured for only certain safe rules and others must go through IT testing.</p> <p>Customer approved to rejected</p> <p>After the rules manager deploys the new rules, we go back to the invoice submission and choose the same invoice that should now be rejected.  We see the invalid pattern of PO number and supplier type and we select in the demo control panel to upgrade to the latest rule version.  The results, rejected with the reason code deployed by the business rule manager.</p> <p>Operations week 2</p> <p>After these new rules are in place for a week, the Operations Specialist reviews their updated dashboard and sees solid improvement with a reduction of average invoice processing time from less invoice rework and also less deviation between the rules and the final invoice decision.  Our rules are more accurate.</p> <p>Use Case Summary</p> <p>We just used decision automation, a capability within IBM Cloud Pak for Automation, to automate an accounts payable process.

Additionally, HR Specialists use multiple, disparate systems to complete their work and can easily lose track of the process.</p> <p>It's time for an easy to use low-code build environment where HR can create dynamic, unified business applications that connect to existing systems and deliver value quickly.</p> <p>Demo Start Page</p> <p>Reviewing the demo launch page we see a text summary describing the demo along with a discovery map and diagram for our reference.  OK, let's launch the demo.</p> <p>Studio Intro</p> <p>Welcome to the Studio low-code build environment.  As an Application Assembler you can use Studio to create Applications and connect to Business Automations.</p> <p>Automation service creation</p> <p>Before we build our application, let's find and connect to some existing workflow and decision services that we want to use.  Studio can connect to external business automation services you already have today and unify them in a single application user experience with the low-code Application Designer.</p> <p>After we connect to Business Automation Workflow HR environment, Studio prompts us to select our the application and operations to automatically import.  We'll select send offer letter and calculate salary range.  The Studio imports and automatically publishes a service and we can confirm the operations and relevant inputs and outputs.  Now we are ready to create our application!</p> <p>Preview onboarding application template</p> <p>Studio includes multiple templates to start from, let's preview and try out the Onboarding Application template.  The app pulls in our sample requisition and candidate data and provides an easy to use search and filter on the left.  After selecting a candidate, we see their details and status; let's mark Alicia as Prepare to onboard, and then change some document status values.</p> <p>Create application from template</p> <p>This template looks good, let's use it to create our own application.</p> <p>Add automation service</p> <p>We start in the low-code Application Designer and it's time to import our automation services from before so we can add them to the app.  It's as simple as drag and drop.  Let's add a button for send offer letter at the upper right, we select the operation, map the data since it already exists in our app from the template, and my button is automatically added.  Don't like grey buttons?  Change it to yellow, rename it, add an icon and make it a little smaller.  All with no code, we just integrated to an existing external workflow from inside our app!</p> <p>We also need to add that calculation service that uses business rules to decide a recommended salary range.  Let's drag it just below the right header and map the data in very much the same way as the other service.  This service returns an output so we let Application Designer create a new variable to hold it and add it to the page automatically, so simple.  With multiple elements on the screen, let's do some simple layout by adding a panel and dragging the fields into it.  We can also do advanced formatting such as setting the field to currency for the symbols and decimal places or moving to advanced mode to set a read only status and much more.  After doing the same to the second field, and formatting the button, we are ready to preview our app!</p> <p>Preview and use automation services</p> <p>Now in the running app, after selecting one of the candidates we immediately see our edits live.  First, let's calculate the salary range and see the values that the decision service brings back based on the candidate data.  Now, before we launch the send offer letter process, let's bring up the current work list.  On the right we see one task from an older process.  Now when we click to send a new offer letter, another task appears on the right for the assignee to complete.  For testing, we can even open the task and see the application passed along the required data.  Looks good to me.</p> <p>Run in Navigator</p> <p>After deploying to the production runtime, called Navigator, we can see the app appear on our home screen, run it and use it as before during the preview but now in a unified Navigator environment with multiple applications and tabs all in one experience and interface!</p> <p>Use Case Summary</p> <p>We just used the low-code Studio environment and its Application Designer to create a dynamic business application from a pre-built template to accelerate time to value.  Then we connected to external automation services including existing workflows and decision services, to help automate the onboarding process.

Click on Bookmarks on the top left area of the viewer  </p> <p></p> <p>After selecting Bookmarks, the list of video bookmarks will be displayed. These were manually entered by an HR specialist during the initial application review process. Each bookmark identifies the name of the bookmark, bookmark description, the time of the bookmark and the user who created the bookmark. The use of video bookmarks is very valuable for Focus Corp to be able to quickly review key segments of the video without viewing the entire video. Additionally, the video viewer enables you to view, collaborate and easily stream large video files without requiring any browser plugins.</p> <p>Entering text in the Filter field also allows you to search on the name of the bookmark allowing for even faster location of a particular bookmark in the event there are numerous bookmarks. For example, enter strengths to quickly go to the bookmark named What is your greatest strengths</p> <p>4. From the bookmark list, click on a bookmark and then cycle through the bookmarks by clicking on the Previous and/or Next buttons  </p> <p></p> <p>Notice that the video starts immediately as you click each bookmark with little or no lag. When the video is initially opened, the video can be played right away as the video is streamed in the background.</p> <p>5. Let's now create a new bookmark. Locate a time in the video to create a bookmark. This can be done by playing the video and pausing at the desired location. Once you have a good idea where to place the bookmark, click on New Bookmark and then enter the Name and optionally the Description. If necessary, adjust the Start Time to the desired time in the video.  </p> <p></p> <p>Go to top | Go to Getting Started Lab</p>"},{"location":"use-cases/onboarding-automation/#8-launch-onboard-employee-process","title":"8.

The data is passed from the process system to the rules in the form of an order and refund request.  This moves through various decision tables including a time window validation that deals with the return reason, the days since delivery and the condition of the goods.  In combination, these lead to various processing decisions and we see a few that result in manual processing listed.  Another decision table deals with the type of goods and may also result in some manual processing.  Finally, this is then combined with a simple text rule to make the final decision.</p> <p>The rules manager drafted up a new branch of the decision model with some updates, let's take a look.  To reduce manual processing, the rules manager adjusted the tables to remove some of the manual processing decisions.  Comparing the two versions shows that row 3 column 3 moved from manual to denied, for example.  Other rows were removed which results in an default approved decision.  We could also test and simulate the rule changes and compare historical results but we won't cover that here in this demo.</p> <p>Customer manual to approved</p> <p>After the Rules Manager deploys the new rules, let go back to being a customer and try them out.

Imagine you lead a shared services team and receive requests from other departments such as Accounts Payable or HR. In person, it's simple to collect information and share status.</p> <p>However, in a remote environment, organizing work is more challenging.  Relying on email and phone is just not enough. Work can be duplicated or executed inconsistently, resulting in lost data and delays.  You need a lightweight workflow to manage incoming requests.</p> <p>Demo Start Page</p> <p>After reviewing the demo launch page including the outline and discovery map, we are ready to launch the Line of Business Supervisor's Workplace interface, the single place you manage all your work.</p> <p>Manage workstream teams</p> <p>You check out the start workflow list and see great starting activities and workflows such as approval, checklist and more.</p> <p>You start by managing the teams.  It's a good idea to add yourself to at least Administrators and Supervisors and maybe Team managers.  You can also create a Shared Services team so you can assign work to them later.</p> <p>Create a workstream</p> <p>Now it's time to create a workstream for incoming shared services requests.  We'll set it so everyone can start and give a description.  The simple, no-code editor allows you to assemble a workflow in just a few clicks.  Start with a checklist activity to represent the skill profile requested.  To make this reusable, we add checklist items with placeholders and allow the user that launches the flow to update and add more.  Let's also add a couple data items for the country and date available.  Once the request is submitted, the shared services team member will complete this form and confirm their skills.  Your first activity is complete!</p> <p>We add another step to get manager approval and setup a simple branch flow.  For the approval branch we add a form to notify of the result.  Then, head back to our approval and add the rejection branch.  So simple!  To complete the workstream, we save and we're ready to go.</p> <p>Test a workstream</p> <p>The new flow starts in trial mode for the author or a testing group to try it out safely before the end users.  Simple to test, we see the launch screen specific to this workstream where the user starting the flow, such as an Accounts Payable clerk, will configure available options including checklist items, and also any activity assignments allowed by the workstream, which we did not activate yet.</p> <p>Once started, we go back to the main Workplace.  Let's take on the role of a shared services team member and see how easy it is to complete the first step. Claim and open the task, check the checklist items, fill in the data, optionally attach a document for review, type a comment and submit.  This is much easier and more organized than email.  Now taking on my team manager role for approval, all looks good and I accept.  Finally, the original requestor receives an approval notification to complete the request. Back at the task list we can switch to workflows and without any customization, the tool provides a complete audit trail of all work by default.</p> <p>Publish a workstream</p> <p>Once ready, I can request a publish to share my workstream with other teams.  The platform has a built-in approval workstream for workstreams!  So we head to the same task list, click to review the workstream definition.  As a publisher, I may send it back with comments or publish directly.  And in just a few minutes, I created, tested and published a new, lightweight workflow available to anyone in my organization: ready to launch!</p> <p>Use Case Summary</p> <p>As you saw, Workstream Services helps you manage remote work more effectively by allowing business users to create lightweight workflows that automate internal processes, no coding required.
